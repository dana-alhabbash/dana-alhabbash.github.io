# dana-alhabbash.github.io

The purpose of this website is to firstly, introduce myself and showcase my experiences, and skills. Secondly, it is to show the visualizations I have created in IAT 355 this far. 

The technologies I used were VS code, where all the code was created. Gitkraken was used to push and merge the code, and github is where it can be publicly accessed. 

To view the website, simply search "dana-alhabbash.github.io" and my website should be able to be viewed.
